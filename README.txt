Reward Dice by PreciseFunnels is an exit intent popup with an email optin form that uses gamification for efficient lead generation in WooCommerce.

== Description ==

= Reward Dice by PreciseFunnels is an exit intent popup with an email optin form that relies on gamification for extremely efficient lead generation in WooCommerce. =

<a href="https://www.precisefunnels.com/reward-dice/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=ahref&utm_campaign=readmetxt1">Reward Dice</a> can help you generate leads at an extremely accelerated rate in comparison to the usual in-your-face popups.

Reward dice relies on gamification, offering your users to roll a 20-sided dice for a chance to win a big discout (naturally, you decide how big of a discount).

<strong>And the best part?</strong>

Reward Dice is completely unlike your usual popup that interrupts (aka, ruins) your visitor's experience of your WooCommerce store by triggering too early.

Reward Dice uses three different mouse and scroll events ways to detect the exact moment when your website visitors are about to leave your site and offers them to play an attractive mini game of chance instead.

In other words, Reward Dice will not offer discounts while your shop visitors are still browsing your site (and hopefully buy your products without any discounts), it only tries to stop them dead in their tracks when they would have left your site anyway.
